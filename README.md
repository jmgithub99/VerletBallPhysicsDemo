# Verlet Ball Physics Demo
Javascript Ball Physics 2D Simulation using Verlet Integration. 
Goal is to learn Javascript! Next major version will use Three.js 3D library.
	This app is a work in progress and not intended to be a robust application for every web browser.
	Tested on iPhone & iPad (Chrome and Safari), and Android Nexus 6P.

	Features:
	- Touching near a ball will pull it to the mouse or touch location. Spring force will hold it in place when dragged
	- General sloped wall collision detection
	- Stable stacked balls
	- Balls move based on gravity vector when tilted on a mobile device. If mobile device is in landscape, tilt 
	  mode is turned off and user is prompted to rotate to Portrait with Orientation lock turned on.
