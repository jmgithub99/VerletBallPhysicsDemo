# VerletBallPhysicsDemo
Javascript Ball Physics 2D Simulation using Verlet Integration. 
Goal is to learn Javascript making a ball physics simulation.
	This app is a work in progress and not intended to be a robust application for every web browser.
	Tested on iPhone & iPad (Chrome and Safari), and Android Nexus 6P. 
	iOS does not allow Portrait lock to be set from Javascript or set full screen, so future version will prompt user to lock portrait mode.

	Features:
	- Touching near a ball will pull it to the mouse or touch location. Spring force will hold it in place when dragged around.
	- General sloped wall collision detection
	- Stable stacked balls
	- Balls move based on gravity vector when tilted on a mobile device
